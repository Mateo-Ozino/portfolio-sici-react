            <span>

              Beyond pixels and vectors, I find harmony in the world of music. Playing the bass and lending my voice to melodies is another facet of my identity. I am a devoted enthusiast of various musical genres, with a particular passion for power metal, heavy metal, and rock. My eclectic taste in music mirrors my versatile approach to design, where I draw inspiration from diverse sources to create engaging and dynamic visuals.

              Art is not just a discipline for me; it's a way of life.
